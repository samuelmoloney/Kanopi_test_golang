## Build Scripts

Bash terminal scripts to build and run the project.


Run the chmod Command: Make all .sh files inside the scripts/ folder executable by running
``` bash
 chmod +x scripts/*.sh
```

Check that the scripts are now executable.
The x in -rwxr-xr-x indicates the script is executable.
```
ls -l scripts/
```
